# Privacy Policy for Screenshot Beautifier

**Last Updated:** January 2, 2026

## Overview

Screenshot Beautifier is a Chrome extension that helps users beautify their screenshots with backgrounds and effects. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your data.**

Specifically:
- We do NOT access your browsing history
- We do NOT track your online activity
- We do NOT collect personal information
- We do NOT send any data to external servers

## How It Works

All image processing happens **locally in your browser**:
1. You paste or upload an image
2. The extension processes it using your browser's Canvas API
3. The beautified image stays on your device
4. Nothing is ever uploaded or shared

## Permissions Explained

Our extension requests the following permissions:

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|---------------|
| `clipboardRead` | To paste images from your clipboard |
| `clipboardWrite` | To copy beautified images to clipboard |
| `activeTab` | To capture screenshots from the current tab (future feature) |

## Third-Party Services

This extension does **not** use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Data Storage

Any settings you configure (like preferred background or shadow level) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's `storage.local` API. This data never leaves your device.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date above.

**TL;DR: Your images and data never leave your computer. Everything happens locally.**
